                        <h3>Red Velvet Cake and the Devil's Food</h3>
                        <p>
                            Velvet cake is thought to have originated in Maryland in the early 20th century. In the 19th century, "velvet" cake, a
                            soft and velvety crumb cake, came to be served as a fancy dessert, in contrast to what had been the more common,
                            coarser-crumbed cake. Around the turn of the 20th century, devil's food cake was introduced, which is how some believe
                            that red velvet cake came about. The key difference between the two cakes is that devil's food cake uses chocolate and
                            red velvet cake uses cocoa.

                        <h3>The rise of a legend!</h3>
                        <p>When foods were rationed in the US during World War II, bakers used boiled beetroot juices to enhance the color of their
                        cakes. Beetroot is found in some red velvet cake recipes. Beetroot was and is used in some recipes as a filler or to
                        retain moisture. Adams Extract, a Texan company, is credited with bringing the red velvet cake to kitchens across
                        America during the Great Depression era, by being one of the first to sell red food coloring and other flavor extracts
                        with the use of point-of-sale posters and tear-off recipe cards. The cake and its original recipe are well known
                        in the United States from New York City's famous Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, which has been dubbed the confection
                        Waldorf-Astoria cake. However, it is widely considered a Southern recipe. Traditionally, red velvet cake is iced with
                        a French-style butter roux icing (also called ermine icing), which is very light and fluffy, but time-consuming to
                        prepare. Cream cheese frosting and buttercream frosting are variations that have increased in popularity.
                        In Canada, the cake was a well-known dessert in the restaurants and bakeries of the Eaton's department store chain in
                        the 1940s and 1950s. Promoted as an exclusive Eaton's recipe, with employees who knew the recipe sworn to silence, many
                        mistakenly believed the cake was the invention of the department store matriarch, Lady Eaton.</p>

                        <h3>And now it is perfect!</h3>
                        <p>In recent years, red velvet cake and red velvet cupcakes have become increasingly popular in the US and many European
                        countries, especially around Christmas and more recently Valentine's Day. A resurgence in the popularity of this cake is
                        attributed by some to the 1989 film Steel Magnolias, which included a red velvet groom's cake made in the shape of an
                        armadillo. Magnolia Bakery in Manhattan has served it since its opening in 1996, as did restaurants known for their
                        Southern cooking like Amy Ruth's in Harlem, which opened in 1998. In 2000, Cake Man Raven opened one of the
                        first bakeries devoted to the cake in Brooklyn. </p>
