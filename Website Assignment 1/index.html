                <h3>Romantic Dessert</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's face it: red velvet cake is the most romantic dessert you can have when you are on a date and want to close it off deliciously. After a fine dinner, what's a better way to close the evening than with a soft, velvety Cake, the inside of which filled with delightful cream cheese? And that is not even mentioning the aesthetic of it. From it's amorous name, to the very colours, the Red Velvet Cake embodies all the visuals of romance and love and serves as a reminder that we are allowed to enjoy the softer things in life... just like your date, am I right????

                <h3>A Celebration</h3>
                <p>The name red velvet is evocative, romantic- but it’s cemented itself in the mainstream so effectively that these connotations aren’t necessarily the first to come to mind- making it not only a romantic cake, but one well suited for other occasions. Red Velvet cake is exciting alternative to “classic” cakes such as plain vanilla or chocolate, while being far less divisive than alternate flavors such as lemon or cinnamon, it’s a risk worth taking- and the calories are worth it too!</p>

            <div class="gridbox">
                <h3>An artistic masterpiece!</h3>
                <p>With all said above, the thing that was emphasised here and there was just the pleasant aesthetics of Red Velvet Cake, which naturally makes you think it's a helping block in those aspects of what makes Red Velvet Cake so great, no? Well, my friend, you could not be more wrong! Its aesthetic potential is, in fact, the main feature of red velvet cake! It is what makes the lovely dessert the empty canvas to he/she who is the artist: the chef. Red Velvet Cake is the voice through which a master baker can express their purest emotions into a flavourful dessert. Not to mention, The contrast of red and white is striking and perfect for your Instagram feed! </p>
